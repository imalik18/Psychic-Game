# Psychic-Game

This is a number guessing game.

It is useful because we can test out how to make the computer respond to our random choices.

They just need to press any alphabet key to get started.

It also tracks your wins if you guess the same letter as the computer or your losses. 

What makes it more fun is that the computer gives you 9 attempts to guess the letter right. 

Your guesses are also tracked so you know how many times it takes for you to get it right.
